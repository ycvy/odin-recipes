    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>With a few simple ingredients, you can have a delicious meal! My husband came up with this recipe while we are on "stay at home" orders due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It was quick, easy, and delicious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>red onion</li>
          <li>tuna packed in olive oil</li>
          <li> capers, drained</li>
          <li>crushed red pepper flakes</li>
          <li>pound spaghetti</li>
          <li>chopped fresh parsley</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until beginning to caramelize, about 10 minutes. Add tuna with oil, capers, and crushed red pepper flakes; heat through.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water for 1 minute less than the package instructs, about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta to the pan and mix to combine. Add some of the pasta water and toss lightly until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 2 more minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
